I made this mod because i was annoyed at how short the radius on trash cans was. If you look at the before picture below you can see that the botanists leave stuff on the ground near the shelves and a trash can placed only 4 pots away is too far to allow cleaners to pick it up.

## Mono vs Il2CPP
This mod exists for both versions of Schedule 1. This one is for the Mono version which is also know as alternate in steam betas tab.

## MelonLoader:
This mod uses MelonLoader version 0.7.0. I have no idea if it works with older versions.

## Configuration
The trash can radius can be configured through MelonLoader's preferences. Find the preferences in the game's root directory > UserData > MelonPreferences.cfg. After running the game once there should be a section in there called [Spood_LargerTrashRadius]. just change the radius' value to whatever you want. It should be 5.5 by default, the game's usual radius is 4.
